-----> In this problem we are given a word and we need to count the frequency of that word and the frequency of the synonyms of that word .
like given word is happy it occoured 16 times in the corpus , glad is a synonyms of the word happy so it occoured 2 times in this way we have to count the frequency of each words.
2)Firstly we have to search the word the in the corpus which is a list of list of Strings , actually it looks like [["sai",prabhu","akhil"."glad"],["sad","angry",dissapointed]]
where the first list is doc1 and the second list is doc2.
3)we have to find the words in Thesarus consists of 2 parts 1st string and a list of its synonym words , the 1st keyword is accessed through "word" keyword and the list of synonyms are accessed using "synonym" keyword .
4)the keyword is given in the search function to which we have to search the frequency in the corpus.
5)firstly we will access each thesarus and check that our desired word is present or not .
6)after we find the desired word we will copy all the synonym  words into the list "synonymwords and we add the keyword in the list at 0th index.
7)for each word in synonym , for each document in corpus we will check the word is present or not is yes increment the count value , do this for all the words in the "synonymwords" list.
